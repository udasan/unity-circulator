Arduino circulator and test project

if you get "GetThreadContext failed" at importing this project first time,
try to remove ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset, then retry to import.

if you succeed to import the project by this way,
select Edit > Project Settings > Player, and set API Compatibility Level
to ".NET 2.0" (NOT ".NET 2.0 Subset") again.
